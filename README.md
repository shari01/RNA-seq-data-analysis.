<h1>RNA Sequencing Analysis of HPV-Positive Head and Neck Cancers</h1>

<h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Public (Available since May 13, 2016)<br>
<strong>Title:</strong> Subtypes of HPV-positive head and neck cancers are associated with HPV characteristics, copy number variations, PIK3CA mutation, and pathway signatures. [RNA-Seq]<br>
<strong>Organism:</strong> Homo sapiens<br>
<strong>Experiment Type:</strong> Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This study addresses the substantial heterogeneity within HPV-positive head and neck cancer (HNC) tumors, which predisposes them to different outcomes. Using unsupervised gene expression clustering on well-annotated HPV(+) HNC samples from two cohorts (84 total primary tumors), as well as 18 HPV(-) HNCs, we identified two distinctive HPV(+) subtypes. Membership in these subtypes correlates with genic viral integration status, E2/E4/E5 expression levels, and the ratio of spliced to full-length HPV oncogene E6.</p>

<p>Notable differences in copy number alterations, particularly the loss of chr16q and gain of chr3q, PIK3CA mutation, and the expression of genes involved in cancer-related biological processes were observed. This characterization provides valuable molecular insights related to the alternative paths of tumor development and informs personalized care for HPV(+) HNC patients.</p>

<h2>Overall Design</h2>
<p>The dataset comprises <strong>36 head and neck primary tumors</strong> (18 HPV+ and 18 HPV-) and their matched blood samples, genotyped by Illumina OmniExpress SNP array. RNA-seq was performed on the same tumor samples.</p>
